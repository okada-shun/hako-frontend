        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Hako Finance!<br>
          Hako Finance is a DeFi application.
          This app makes it possible for user to transfer, get, lend, borrow and create valuable token.
          <br><br>
          Hako Finance application has three components, Hako, hako token and hako member.<br>
          Hako is a smart contract deployed to ethereum network.
          Hako token, or token, is a token used in this app.
          Hako member, or member, is an account to join Hako Finance system.
          You can turn your account into hako member account in "join Hako" transaction.
          By using member account, you can do various transactions.
          <br><br>

          <p>

            This is the transaction that you lend your credit to other member account.
